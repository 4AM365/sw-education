## Cases

### Snake case:
- good for variables and method names, as well as file names

- must be lowercase

    number_of_donuts = 24

    fave_phrase = "Hello World"

### SCREAMING SNAKE CASE:
- all caps
- used to declare constants

    NUMBER_OF_DONUTS = 34

    FAVE_PHRASE = "Hello World"

### Kebab case:
- Most human-readable way to type variables
- used mostly in URLs
- makes things easily readable by indexers because it's interpreted as two words, so repo library names are a good use of this

### Camel case:
- Has a hump in the middle
- Starts lowercase, then cap first letter of each following word
- used in Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript for variables, functions, and method names

    numberOfDonuts = 34
    
    favePhrase = "Hello World"

### Pascal case:
- Similar to camel case, but first letter of the word is capitalized
- Used to name classes in most languages

    NumberOfDonuts = 34

    FavePhrase = "Hello World"
